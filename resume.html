								Full-stack software engineer on the Growth Activation and Acquisition teams focused on converting visitor traffic into paying customers. Highlights:<br/><br/>
								
								- Authored Instacart’s internal Rich Text framework, enabling developers to define server-side styling for rendered text across Web, iOS, and Android. Identified both a user need from retailer and marketing tooling requests and a technical gap where engineers were re-implementing styles across the three clients. Delivered foundational extensions to the internal API framework, and the resulting system is now used by all teams in the Core Experience organization with more than 500 code references.<br/><br/>
								
								- Led development of the Self-Serve Landing Page System. Observed that engineers across the organization required roughly two weeks to build new landing pages end-to-end and standardized the landing page component architecture in partnership with the Instacart Design System team, reducing it to nine core components. Defined server–client contracts across API and storage layers, and built custom CMS page builder tooling to support no-code creation and visualization. Reduced page implementation time from two weeks to two hours, enabled PMs and Marketers to be the primary page creators, and have launched more than 200 distinct landing pages to date.

                                Relatively little research exists on the use of smartwatches to support learning. This paper presents an approach for commodity smartwatches as a tool for situated reflection in elementary school science. The approach was embodied in a smartwatch app called ScienceStories that allows students to voice record reflections about science concepts anytime, anywhere. We conducted a study with 18 fifth-grade children to investigate first, the effects of ScienceStories on students' science self-efficacy, and second the effects of different motivational structures (gamification, narrative-based, hybrid) designed into the smartwatch app on students' quality and quantity of use. Quantitative results showed ScienceStories increased science self-efficacy especially with a motivational structure. The gamified version had the highest quantity of use, while narrative performance performed worst. Qualitative findings described how students' recordings related to science topics and were contextualized. We discuss how our findings contribute to understanding of how to design smartwatch apps for educational purposes.

                                This paper extends the concept of digital literacy and applies it to Making. Through case descriptions, we contribute an understanding of how children can become or fail to become individuals literate in Making within a formal learning context. Our analysis draws from video recordings and other data sources of two 4th grade classrooms in which the students, who had already participated in 1.5 years of more structured 'makified activities', engaged in an open-ended, exploration-based, and playful task that was more in line with the spirit of Making. Student teams were classified as 'high in Making literacy' and 'low in Making literacy', revealing how Making literacy was expressed at the level of skills, mental models, and practices in various ways for different students. Our qualitative analysis demonstrates what burgeoning Making literacy may mean in a public elementary school classroom, paving the way for a vision of a time when Making becomes generalized practice.
